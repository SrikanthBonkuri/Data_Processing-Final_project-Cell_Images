# Cell Images
Greg Howard & Srikanth Bonkuri

## Plan

Our plan for breaking up future work falls largely into the categories of (a) computer vision tasks, which will enhance the data frame we can analyze, and (b) unsupervised learning, which will provide exploratory data analyses that may be informative to a deep learning model in a future project.

### Computer Vision
Srikanth's work to complete by Saturday 11/26
* Height (SB)
* Width (SB)
* Centroid (SB) - note: this is the location on the image as x and y coordinates
Greg's work to complete by Friday 12/2
* Distortedness (GH) - note: this is a measure of the deviation from a perfect circle

### Unsupervised Learning
Teamwork to complete by Sunday 12/4
* PCA (both)
* K-Means (both)
* SVM (both)
